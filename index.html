    Emily is a songwriter and a classical pianist.

    A student at Berklee College of Music, she dual majors in Music Production and Engineering (MPE) and Music Business (MB). MPE because of her love of beautiful recordings, and MB for a look into the music industry, how business and law functions and serves in the music industry.

    Music, for her, is a way to escape, a time to look inward, figure some questions out and hopefully, learn some insights along the way.

    Therefore, most of her songsðŸŽ¤ are ballads. They are unreleased, but plans were drawn up and soon they will be on major platforms.
